# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Analysis System 

An end-to-end Machine Learning project built to predict customer churn and support data-driven retention strategies for subscription-based businesses. This project is inspired by a real-world telecom industry use case and demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a data science solution, from data preprocessing and model development to deployment and business impact.

The system analyzes customer demographic details, service usage behavior, contract information, and billing patterns to predict the probability of churn for each customer. A structured data preprocessing pipeline is applied, including data cleaning, feature encoding, and transformation, ensuring the model learns meaningful patterns from real-world data. Instead of providing only binary outcomes, the model generates probability-based predictions, enabling businesses to identify high-risk customers early.

To bridge the gap between technical predictions and business decision-making, the application highlights customers with high churn risk and provides actionable insights that can be used for targeted retention strategies such as personalized offers, loyalty programs, or improved customer support. This makes the solution practical and business-oriented rather than purely technical.

The complete project is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload CSV datasets, preview data, generate individual churn predictions, and analyze summary insights through an intuitive interface. The deployment showcases the ability to convert a machine learning model into a production-ready application that can be used by non-technical stakeholders.

This project reflects strong hands-on experience in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, feature engineering, and deployment, while maintaining a clear focus on real-world business problems. It is well-suited for demonstrating readiness for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Analytics internship roles.
